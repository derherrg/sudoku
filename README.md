# Sudoku
My take on a simple Sudoku solver. If a solution cannot simply be obtained by
applying the rules of the game, the solver will try to guess values for fields.
If the given sudoku cannot be solved because it is faulty, the solver will nag.

Usage should be pretty self-explicatory: Just create a new Sudoko-object, fill
it with some values, and then run the .solve() method. Have fun! :)
